Code repository for the paper - 'Seeing through the Static: Reduced Imagery Vividness in Aphantasia is Associated with Impaired Temporal Lobe Signal Complexity'

NB: Some MATLAB scripts call a datastructure "All_glm_fc.mat". This file was too large to include in the repository but can be created using 'GLM.m'.
